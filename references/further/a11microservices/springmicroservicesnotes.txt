Components of Spring Boot Microservices:

Spring Cloud: Spring Cloud is an umbrella project that provides tools for building and managing microservices. It includes modules for service discovery, load balancing, configuration management, circuit breakers, and more.

Service Discovery (Eureka): Spring Cloud Eureka is a service registry and discovery server. It allows microservices to register themselves and discover other services in the ecosystem. This enables dynamic scaling and routing.

API Gateway (Zuul): Spring Cloud Zuul acts as an API gateway that manages the routing, filtering, and load balancing of requests to different microservices. It helps simplify the client-side communication with multiple services.

Load Balancing: Spring Cloud provides load balancing capabilities to distribute incoming requests across instances of a microservice. Ribbon is a client-side load balancer used for this purpose.

Configuration Management (Config Server): Spring Cloud Config Server manages externalized configuration for microservices. It allows you to centralize configuration properties for different environments and services.

Circuit Breaker (Hystrix): Spring Cloud Hystrix helps prevent system failures due to service outages. It provides a circuit breaker pattern to handle and manage failures gracefully.

Distributed Tracing (Sleuth): Spring Cloud Sleuth provides distributed tracing to track requests across various microservices. It helps diagnose and troubleshoot performance issues.

API Documentation (Swagger): Although not exclusive to microservices, Swagger or Springfox is often used with Spring Boot to generate API documentation and provide an interactive UI for testing APIs.

Authentication and Authorization (Spring Security): Spring Security is used to handle authentication and authorization in microservices, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources.

Containerization and Orchestration: While not part of Spring Boot itself, Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes are often used to deploy, manage, and scale microservices containers.
